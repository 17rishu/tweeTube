# Summary of this project

It is a platform on which user can upload, view, like, comment and can also tweet at the same place kinda youtube and twitter at one place, just by creating thier account with us or just login, if there account exists.

This project is a complex backend project that is built with nodejs, expressjs, mongodb, mongoose, jwt, bcrypt, and many more. This project is a complete backend project that has all the features that a backend project should have.
I am building a complete video hosting website similar to youtube with all the features like login, signup, upload video, like, dislike, comment, reply, subscribe, unsubscribe, and many more.

Project uses all standard practices like JWT, bcrypt, access tokens, refresh Tokens and many more. I have spent a lot of time in building this project and I am pretty sure that this project taught me a lot alone.
